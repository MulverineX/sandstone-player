# Sandstone Player

A [Sandstone](https://github.com/TheMrZZ/sandstone) data pack library for interfacing with the Player

Uses my [Label](https://github.com/MulverineX/sandstone-label) library to make tag usage easier.

To build the datapack, run:
```ts
npm run build
// or
yarn build
// or
sand build
```

To automatically rebuild the datapack on each change, run:
```ts
npm run watch
// or
yarn watch
// or
sand watch
```
